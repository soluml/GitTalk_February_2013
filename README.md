Responsive/Adaptive Design - Meetup February '13
================================================

It's your co-host Ben this time around! Ready for number 3?

This time we're going to be spending some time focusing on the web's mobile visitors discussing the latest trends in web design; responsive and adaptive design. **Mobile is the undeniable future of the web, are you ready for it?**

Responsive design (as wikipedia puts it) "is an approach to web design in which a site is crafted to provide an optimal viewing experience—easy reading and navigation with a minimum of resizing, panning, and scrolling—across a wide range of devices (from desktop computer monitors to mobile phones)". Truly a one size fits all solution.

You can think of Adaptive design, as a concept, like responsive design on steroids. You take into consideration all of the target devices and add functionality those users can benefit from. It responds to the size of the device, and adapts to the capabilities of the platform.

**Clear as mud? Good. You'll just have to come learn about it then.**

Make sure to bring your laptops/ipads/mobile devices... we're going to be having fun!

See you all there!
